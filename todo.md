- disable tinyproxy optionally
- split docker-compose.yml into separate services?
- store computed files in tmp instead of home
- dump nefunguje
- check generated instance id
- allow specifying files to include from any forder in host system per-user (not -per project)
  - allow specify custom in snadbox path
- allow specifuing per-project apt-get depndencies with versions
- per user domain whitelist
- allow two-way volume for .claude/plans etc, maybe copy snaphost only of .claude.json, but .claude folder mount directly
- resolve symbolic links in host system while copying files claude, or use user name same as host
